# ProjectPet

***
Disclaimer: I worked on this project for the first time in August 2020, which is about ~3 months after I started teaching myself Swift. Several months later, I decided to re-do this project and see what I would do differently. This repo contains the Old version(August 2020) and new version(Feb 2021). Both app contains the same functionalities.

Why: 
Simple project created for a small veterinary clinic. The application allow their users to contact them easily and are able to provide information in return about their pets. 

What:

	•	Fetch the config.json file to check for chat and call feature availability and work hours. 

	•	Show different alert as well as disable call, chat buttons accordingly if outside of work ours. 
	
	•	Fetch the pets.json for pet information to display on the screen

	•	Tapping on a pet info cell would open a new screen that loads the pet information on a webview
	
	•	Views adjust to orientation and screen size accordingly using Autolayout constraints.

	•	Used Github to host both json files.
