# ProjectPet

Simple project created for a small veterinary clinic. The application allow their users to contact them easily and are able to provide information in return about their pets. 

	•	Fetch the config.json file to check for chat and call feature availability and work hours. 

	•	Show different alert and disable call button if outside of work ours. 
	
	•	Fetch the pets.json for pet information to display on the screen

	•	Tapping on a pet info cell would open a new screen that loads the pet information on a webview
	
	•	Views adjust to orientation and screen size accordingly using Autolayout constraints.

	•	Used Github to host both json files.
